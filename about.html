<p>Hi! I am an Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate, but have since become more interested in Data science and machine learning. I have built this webiste in order to share some of the work I create as part of my Data science learning journey.</p>

<p>I will try to crank out as many interesting projects and articles, as my time will allow. If you want to get in touch or to suggest a topic for me to discover, please write me at bk-ikram@hotmail.com. Also, get in touch with me through my social media links.</p>
